2014-07-08  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fix to \PgD definition, which was for some reason overwritten
	and meant that all Delta baryons were written as E^0!! Thanks to
	David Fokkema for the bug report.

	* Improvements to mkmacrotables: \PSB is now entered properly, and
	there are sf variants of all the displayed contexts.

	* Removing itforce, maybess, noss options: not used in latest hepparticles.

2013-07-19  Andy Buckley  <andy.buckley@cern.ch>

	* Fix the option passing from hepnames and hepnicenames to
	heppennames and beyond. The problem was just in the relative
	ordering of option parsing and package loading...

	* Improving and fixing the macro dump script: macro docs are now
	written out in three forms, including a version which tests the
	[italic] option.
