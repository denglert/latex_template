hepnames --- a set of pre-defined high energy particle names
             built using the hepparticles package

-----------------------------------------------------------

hepnames is a pair of LaTeX packages, heppennames and hepnicenames, providing a
large set of pre-defined high energy physics particle names built with the
hepparticles package. This means that the particle name macros can be used in
and out of math mode, and will adapt according to the context in which they are
called: for example, particles in a bold region of text or a section header will
automatically be typeset in bold type.

heppennames re-implements the particle names in pennames.sty, with some
additions and alterations and greater flexibility and robustness due to the
hepparticles structures, which were written for this purpose.

hepnicenames provides the main non-resonant particle names from heppennames with
more "friendly" names. The full list of macro names, as well as more general
package documentation, can be found in the hepnames PDF and PS files. The full
list of macros and typeset forms in various contexts are listed in the
specific heppennames and hepnicenames PDF and PS files.

Finally, the simplest choice is the hepnames package, which imports both
heppennames and hepnicenames and accepts the same package options as those two.

These packages are based around pennames.sty by Michel Goosens and Eric van
Herwijnen.
